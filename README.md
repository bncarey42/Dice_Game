# Dice_Game
This program simulates a simple game of street dice.
The rules are as follows
        1. Place a bet.
        2. On the first roll if a 7 or 11 is rolled, YOU WIN!
            However, if a 2, 3, or 12 is rolled YOU LOSE.
        3. If the game has not been won or lost yet the first roll becomes your points.
        4. Rolls continue until you either:
            roll your point in which case YOU WIN
               -or-
            roll a 7 in which case YOU LOSE
